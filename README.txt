### Instructions for configuring IlluminaSNPs_Pipeline.sh ###
 
1. Set the DATADIR variable to the location (local or network-based filesystem) containing the Illumina MiSeq datasets is mounted.
- (Ex. DATADIR=/data/Illumina_MiSeq_Datasets

2. Set the ISNPS variable to the location where IlluminaSNPs_Pipeline.sh will be executed from.
- (Ex. ISNPS=/data/IlluminaSNPs_Pipeline)

3. Set the PREV_RUNS variable to the location where IlluminaSNPs_Pipeline.sh will track all Illumina MiSeq data that has been ingested and prepared for analysis.
- (Ex. PREV_RUNS=/data/IlluminaSNPs_Pipeline/prev_runs.txt)

4. Set the CURR_RUNS variable to the location where IlluminaSNPs_Pipeline.sh will write a list of all current Illumina MiSeq sequencer runs residing in DATADIR.
- (Ex. CURR_RUNS=/data/IlluminaSNPs_Pipeline/curr_runs.txt)

5. Set the PEND_RUNS variable to the location where IlluminaSNPs_Pipeline.sh will write a list of all Illumina MiSeq sequencer runs (different between PREV_RUNS and CURR_RUNS) that are pending and need to be ingested and prepared for analysis.
- (Ex. PEND_RUNS=/data/IlluminaSNPs_Pipeline/pend_runs.txt)

6. Set the FQFILES variable to the location where IlluminaSNPs_Pipeline.sh will write a list of all FASTQ files detected for each of the Illumina MiSeq sequencer runs.
- (Ex. FQFILES=/data/IlluminaSNPs_Pipeline/.illumina_fastqfiles.txt)

7. Set the FQCMDGEN variable to the location where IlluminaSNPs_Pipeline.sh will generate a list of all commands that will be used for locating FASTQ files in parallel from the MiSeq run data directory.
- (Ex. FQCMDGEN=/data/IlluminaSNPs_Pipeline/.illumina_fastqcmdgen.txt

8. Set the FQCPCMDS variable to the location where IlluminaSNPs_Pipeline.sh will generate a list of all commands that will be used for copying the FASTQ files in parallel from the MiSeq run data directory to DATADIR.
- (Ex. FQCPCMDS=/data/IlluminaSNPs_Pipeline/.illumina_fastqcpfiles.txt)

9. Set the PID_FILE variable to the location where IlluminaSNPs_Pipeline.sh will generate a PID (lock file) for this pipeline.  This will prevent multiple people from running this pipeline at once.
- (Ex. PID_FILE=/data/IlluminaSNPs_Pipeline/.illumina_analyze.pid)


### Instructions for running IlluminaSNPs_Pipeline.sh ###

1. The IlluminaSNPs_Pipeline.sh script is currently supported for running on Linux, and Mac systems. 
2. The following packages must be installed to properly run IlluminaSNPs_Pipeline.sh:

- GNU parallel: https://www.gnu.org/software/parallel
- Parallel Implementation of GZIP (PIGZ): https://zlib.net/pigz
